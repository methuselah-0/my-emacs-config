;; Set `guix-warning-port' here, otherwise, some output from the
;; guix-daemon would not be displayed in the Guix REPL.  For the same
;; `current-build-output-port' should also be set, but since it is used
;; only by build procedures from (emacs-guix actions) module, it is set
;; there.
;;
;; The same workaround is made for `guix-devel-mode' to set up a Guile
;; REPL (guix-devel-mode does not use Guix REPL).  See
;; `guix-devel-setup-repl' elisp procedure.
