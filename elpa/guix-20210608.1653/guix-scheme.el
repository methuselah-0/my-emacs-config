;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides `guix-scheme-mode'.

;;; Code:

(require 'scheme)
(require 'guix-utils)

(defvar guix-scheme-display-message t
  "If non-nil, display a message after enabling `guix-scheme-mode'.
This message allows you to see that the current buffer is
indented (while the original buffer file may not be indented).")

;;;###autoload
(define-derived-mode guix-scheme-mode scheme-mode "Scheme"
  "Major mode for editing Scheme code.
This mode is the same as `scheme-mode', except it also reindents
the current buffer after it is enabled."
  (guix-pretty-print-buffer)
  ;; There may be long lines (like lists of strings), so display them on
  ;; multiple lines.
  (setq truncate-lines nil)
  (when guix-scheme-display-message
    (message "This buffer has been indented by `guix-scheme-mode'.")))

(provide 'guix-scheme)
